Notice from spectre during IC analysis, during transient analysis `timeSweep'.

Warning from spectre during IC analysis, during transient analysis `timeSweep'.
    WARNING (CMI-2682): M_i_1: The bulk-source junction forward bias voltage (907.132 mV) exceeds `VjsmFwd' = 843.248 mV.  The results are now incorrect because the junction current model has been linearized
Notice from spectre during IC analysis, during transient analysis `timeSweep'.
    X1.cDec2: Initial condition computed for node X1.n51 is in error by 9.92613 uV.
        Decrease `rforce' to reduce error in computed initial conditions.  However, setting rforce too small may result in convergence difficulties or in the matrix becoming singular.

Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(X1.nBiStable) = 10 V
I: I(X1.eBiStable:p) = 19.78 A
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.
