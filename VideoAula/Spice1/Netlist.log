DC Analysis `srcSweep'
**********************

Notice from spectre during DC analysis `srcSweep'.
    No outputs were found. Loosening output filter criterion to `allpub'.


Opening the PSF file Netlist.raw/srcSweep.dc ...
Important parameter values:
    reltol = 1e-03
    abstol(V) = 1 uV
    abstol(I) = 1 pA
    temp = 27 C
    tnom = 27 C
    tempeffects = all
    gmindc = 1 pS

Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(A) = 1 V
I: I(Vvdd:p) = 741 uA
Convergence achieved in 2 iterations.
DC simulation time: CPU = 1.782 ms, elapsed = 70.9002 ms.
Total time required for dc analysis `srcSweep': CPU = 1.834 ms, elapsed = 70.9481 ms.
Time accumulated: CPU = 172.652 ms, elapsed = 787.41 ms.
Peak resident memory used = 51.3 Mbytes.


Aggregate audit (9:44:49 AM, Thur Jan 28, 2021):
Time used: CPU = 175 ms, elapsed = 854 ms, util. = 20.4%.
Time spent in licensing: elapsed = 54 ms, percentage of total = 6.32%.
Peak memory used = 51.8 Mbytes.
Simulation started at: 9:44:48 AM, Thur Jan 28, 2021, ended at: 9:44:49 AM, Thur Jan 28, 2021, with elapsed time (wall clock): 854 ms.
spectre completes with 0 errors, 0 warnings, and 1 notice.
